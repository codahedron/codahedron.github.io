The website design is now more or less finished, atleast as far as a website design can be finished... Welcome to our site!

It is based on my own portfolio site, but with some significant changes and upgrades, mainly a heavy use of [css grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout). (Perhaps too heavy? The future will tell!) For now I am really finding grids to be a godsend. More intuitive than I personally have ever found css flex to be, and so very powerful.

In any case, we are Codahedron, and by the time you read this, you probably know a bit about us. If not, no doubt there will be plenty of information somewhere on this site.

To a great journey ahead!
