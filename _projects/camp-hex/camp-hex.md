# Camp Hex
Adventuring is a tough job, and sometimes you need somewhere to rest. Indeed it may be vital to have a home base to return to for stocking up on supplies and unloading all that loot.

In Camp Hex, players can put their hard earned loot towards building a base, and a supply chain to allow them to create better gear, and go on ever more daring adventures.

The game can be downloaded below, but beware that the game is not yet near release, and the game server is only up occasionally.
