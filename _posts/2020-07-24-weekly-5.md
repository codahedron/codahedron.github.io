We have not added that many features this weak. Rather we have spent time refactoring the system that we already have, so that we can easier extend it with more functionality in the future.

I have worked on refactoring the network map. I have also started to put back the tests which were removed during the great refactoring.

Ecen has worked on the parser, written some tests and worked with the world generating system.

On top of these things we have also done other refactoring and bug fixes. So this might not have been the best week for adding functionality. But it was one of the better ones for removing todos from our [trello](https://trello.com) page.
