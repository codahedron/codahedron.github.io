During spring we came to the decision of putting Network: Override on hold for now. We feel that we've simply made to many cool systems, and too little game, and turning it into a game feel too daunting of a task now.

Instead, we're using much of the game's graphic engine to develop a new, but much smaller game! Currently we're using the working title "Camp Hex". The main idea this time is to make sure that it becomes a game as soon as possible, and making it good can come later :)

In any case, you can check out the latest builds [here](/camp-hex/).
