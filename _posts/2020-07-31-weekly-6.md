This week has been some much needed time off for both me and Algot. Likely, so may the next couple of weeks be too as exam season starts. So expect a two week break in weekly updates.

Yet we did sneak in a couple of improvements and tests this week anyway. But most importantly, this week saw the completion of the main theme song for the game, going by the name Ellipsis. We won't be sharing this music with you just yet, but we're very happy with how it turned out.

See you in a few weeks!
