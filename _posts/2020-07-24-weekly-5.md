We have not added that many features this weak. Rather we have spent time refactoring the system that we already have, so that we can easier extend it with more functionality in the future.

I have worked with the network map. Moving logic to places where they make more sense, and making the map more integrated into the app/subapp system that we have. For example: Making the nodes on the map subapps of it. (Similar to how Console is a subapp of Window, which is a subapp of WindowManager, etc.)

I have also started to put back the tests which were removed during the great refactoring. This was done since we started experience some of the old bugs again, since the apps were rewritten somewhat to make them fit the new system.

Ecen has worked on the parser, written some tests and worked with the world generating system.

On top of these things we have also done other refactoring and bug fixes. So this might not have been the best week for adding functionality. But it was one of the better ones for removing todos from our [trello](https://trello.com) page.
